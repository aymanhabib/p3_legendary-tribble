Shattered by a thousand highs,
caressing the void like an old friend,
“Darling, you’re coming home…”

Halfway to the divine,
failing to face that we’re malformed:
stars do not align.

Howling chasm, I
found you.
Oh, how I chased you down,
I loved you more than anyone.
Than anyone.

Lingering above the head,
a twisted knife:
our own fate.
“Darling, you’re coming home…”

Fell toward you through a crack in his eye.
The infinite is unfazed;
I’m conquered,
I’m alive.

Howling chasm, I
found you.
Oh, how I chased you down,
I loved you more than anyone.
Than anyone.

It’s the glittering prize
to know you’re going to die.

Halfway to the divine…
Halfway to the divine…

Howling chasm, I
found you.
Oh, how I chased you down,
I loved you more than anyone.
Than anyone.
(How I chased you down)
(I loved you more)
(I loved you more)

“Darling, you’re coming home…”
“Darling, you’re coming home…”

Coming home.
